-- Atomically reaping stale workers.
--
-- KEYS[1]: The hash key for active connections.
-- KEYS[2]: The hash key for lifetime connections.
-- ARGV: A list of worker IDs to check for staleness.
--
-- For each worker ID in ARGV, this script checks if the corresponding worker
-- heartbeat key ("worker:<worker_id>") exists. If it does not exist, the worker
-- is considered stale, and its entries are removed from the active and lifetime
-- connection hashes.
--
-- Returns a list of worker IDs that were successfully reaped.
